## PalMeet

## What problems are we facing today?

People are having several meetings at different times in a day. It&#39;s quite inconvenient to track the exact date, time, and availability of your team.

When we want to start a meeting we need to check the availability of every individual member.

After creating a meeting, we need to share meeting credentials with every member. We use platforms like Whatsapp, Gmail e.t.c

When the meeting is about to start, it takes a long time to search for meeting credentials that may be mixed up in chats. Sometimes the timing of the meetings may overlap without the knowledge of the participants.

What google calendar, microsoft calendar is not doing?

You cannot check for availability of your team.You can only set a reminder about a meeting.

It won&#39;t warn if multiple meetings overlap.

It won&#39;t help you sharing meeting credentials.

## Solution we built:

Every user will have an upcoming meeting list with the meeting credentials.

Admin or meeting host can create a group of people (with group names like &quot;Backend people&quot;, &quot;Frontend people&quot;). Group invitation will be sent to every member, and they will become group-member if they approve the invitation. The admin can check for the availability of the group members at a given time(say 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM). And it will display all available and non-available members. Then he can send meeting credentials for available members.

Every member gets this invitation, If a member accepts a meeting, It will be added to the upcoming meeting list.
