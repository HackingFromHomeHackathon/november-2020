# #HackingFromHome - November 2020

COVID-19 has impacted work across industries, and moved most non-service jobs to be remote. We are now *hacking from* home. The goal of this hackathon is to create new solutions that optimize remote work for everyone.

Participate in the hackathon on **November 10 – 17, 2020** for a chance to **win cash prizes totaling $6,000 along with exclusive Mattermost and Jitsi merchandise**.

## Registration

You can register for the hackathon [on the event website](https://mattermost.com/hackfest2020/#registrationCta), and join the Hackathon platform at [hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com](https://hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com/).

## How do I get started?

1. Register for updates at https://mattermost.com/hackfest2020/#registrationCta.
2. Join Mattermost hackathon platform at [hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com](https://hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com/).
3. Begin collaborating with others on ideas in Mattermost, and optionally form a team.
4. Work on your project with your team until November 17, 2020.
5. Submit your project [following the steps below](#how-do-i-submit-my-project).

## How do I submit my project?

**Submissions are accepted until 23:00 GMT-0 on November 17, 2020.**

Submit your Hackathon project following these steps:
1. [Create a new file in `submissions` folder](https://github.com/HackingFromHomeHackathon/november-2020/new/master/submissions). Please use `.md` as the extension of the file.
2. Name the file `<your-github-username>-<your-submission-name>.md`. For example, `jasonblais-onedrive-plugin.md`.
3. Include the following: 
   1. Link to a repository containing your project (e.g. an integration or plugin), or a link to a page to download it for evaluation.

   2. Brief summary of your project, including:
     
      - Problem statement: What is the specific problem you’re solving?
      - What are the underlying use cases the bot would cover.
      - Your approach and solution.
      - (Optional) Any supporting references, diagrams or demos that depict your solution.

   3. Supporting references, diagrams or demos that depict your solution. Typically one or both of the following:
      - Brief video (screen capture with voiceover) that gives an overview of the project, the motivation behind it, and how it works to achieve it.
      - Basic documentation with a screenshot of the solution in action, list of features, and development guide if applicable. A great example is [this README of the GitLab-Mattermost plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab/blob/master/README.md).

   4. A link to submit issues and questions, such as a public issue tracker in GitHub.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page, then select **Create a new branch** and click **Propose new file**.
5. On the next screen, submit your changes as a pull request. If other members worked with you on the project, please make sure to include their names in your pull request description, so we can correctly attribute everyone’s work.

You can see a [sample submission here](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-hackathon-nov2019/pull/1).
