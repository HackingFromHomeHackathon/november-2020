# #HackingFromHome - November 2020

COVID-19 has impacted work across industries, and moved most non-service jobs to be remote. We are now *hacking from* home. The goal of this hackathon is to create new solutions that optimize remote work for everyone.

Participate in the hackathon on **November 10 – 17, 2020** for a chance to **win cash prizes totaling $6,000 along with exclusive Mattermost and Jitsi merchandise**.

## Registration

You can register for the hackathon [on the event website](https://mattermost.com/hackfest2020/#registrationCta), and join the Hackathon platform at [hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com](https://hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com/).

## How do I get started?

1. Register for updates at https://mattermost.com/hackfest2020/#registrationCta.
2. Join Mattermost hackathon platform at [hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com](https://hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com/).
3. Begin collaborating with others on ideas in Mattermost, and optionally form a team.
4. Work on your project with your team until November 17, 2020.
5. Submit your project [following the steps below](#how-do-i-submit-my-project).

## How do I submit my project?

**Submissions are accepted until 23:00 GMT-0 on November 17, 2020.**

Submit your Hackathon project following these steps:
1. [Create a new file in `submissions` folder](https://github.com/HackingFromHomeHackathon/november-2020/new/master/submissions). Please use `.md` as the extension of the file.
2. Name the file `<your-github-username>-<your-submission-name>.md`. For example, `jasonblais-onedrive-plugin.md`.
3. Include the following: 
   1. Link to a repository containing your project (e.g. an integration or plugin), or a link to a page to download it for evaluation.

   2. Brief summary of your project, including:
     
      - Problem statement: What is the specific problem you’re solving?
      - What are the underlying use cases the bot would cover.
      - Your approach and solution.
      - (Optional) Any supporting references, diagrams or demos that depict your solution.

   3. Supporting references, diagrams or demos that depict your solution. Typically one or both of the following:
      - Brief video (screen capture with voiceover) that gives an overview of the project, the motivation behind it, and how it works to achieve it.
      - Basic documentation with a screenshot of the solution in action, list of features, and development guide if applicable. A great example is [this README of the GitLab-Mattermost plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab/blob/master/README.md).

   4. A link to submit issues and questions, such as a public issue tracker in GitHub.
4. Submit your changes as a pull request. If other members worked with you on the project, please make sure to include their names in your pull request description, so we can correctly attribute everyone’s work.
