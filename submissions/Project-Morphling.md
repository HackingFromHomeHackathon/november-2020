# Project Morphling

## Overview

Project Morphling builds on top of [Jitsi Meet] and [Spot] to provide a simple and unified way for having meetings on the largest screen in the house.

<hr />

[Spot] is a physical room system for [Jitsi Meet], but it requires a specific application to run on a desktop computer hooked up to the TV, or at least a browser. Then a remote app is needed to control it. Since there is already a Jitsi Meet application for having meetings on mobile devices, it only makes sense to unify all these into a single app: the Jitsi Meet app.

With Project Morphling the Jitsi Meet app can now:

- Run on Android TV and be controlled remotely
- Act as a remote control for instances running on Android TV
- Detect nearby TVs using Bluetooth beacons

In addition to joining meetings on the app itself (like before).
