## Education as an Economic Alternative

During the twentieth century in Canada, native people have struggled with the aftermath of the Residential School System where children were taken from thier parents and boarded in schools which mostly were run by peodophiles. Actual education was non-existent and the trauma of education on children who became adults carries on to modern times. Furthermore, the economic environment for native people on Canadian reservations is brutal to say the least. People want to learn and obtain a high school education equivalent to the non-native population and very much want to work and be productive. One of the ways to survive on a reserve is through piece-meal education projects and a common saying is that education is the new buffalo.

At present in the United States of America there is a pandemic of frightening proportions. Two facets of the social structure under stress are education and the economy. Somehow people have to work and be paid and people have to be educated. This project is to explore, and perhaps create, an oportunity to make education a means of production and establish a different economic system. 

When Covid hit various countries in the world, society as a whole shut down and children had to be educated at home through social meeting platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Jitsi was created as an open source social meeting platform which can be modified and used to create online classrooms. There are also many different platforms that can be integrated to create completely different learning environments. From the effects of the present pandemic, an entirely different approach to education becomes vital and can be used as a way to redistribute wealth by people being productive in an education environment.

## Facets of Education

When the pandemic hit teachers were forced to scramble to create an online education system overnight with no help from school boards, political authorities or any organization which was geared to support teachers. Google classroom had to be utilized with little or no documentation and teachers just had to figure it out on their own. Parents had to support their children's learning on an ad hoc basis. To date there is still little support for online education even though it is highly likely that students will soon be barred from going to school. Or else, there will be a huge demand to pull students from school and use home schooling completely online.
