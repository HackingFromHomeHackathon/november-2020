## Education as an Economic Alternative

During the twentieth century in Canada, native people have struggled with the aftermath of the Residential School System where children were taken from thier parents and boarded in schools which mostly were run by peodophiles. Actual education was non-existent and the trauma of education on children who became adults carries on to modern times. Furthermore, the economic environment for native people on Canadian reservations is brutal to say the least. People want to learn and obtain a high school education equivalent to the non-native population and very much want to work and be productive. One of the ways to survive on a reserve is through piece-meal education projects and a common saying is that education is the new buffalo.

At present in the United States of America there is a pandemic of frightening proportions. Two facets of the social structure under stress are education and the economy. Somehow people have to work and be paid and people have to be educated. This project is to explore, and perhaps create, an opportunity to make education a means of production and establish a different economic system. 

When Covid hit various countries in the world, society as a whole shut down and children had to be educated at home through social meeting platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Jitsi was created as an open source social meeting platform which can be modified and used to create online classrooms. There are also many different platforms that can be integrated to create completely different learning environments. From the effects of the present pandemic, an entirely different approach to education becomes vital and can be used as a way to redistribute wealth by people being productive in an education environment.

## Facets of Education

When the pandemic hit teachers were forced to scramble to create an online education system overnight with no help from school boards, political authorities or any organization which was geared to support teachers. Google classroom had to be utilized with little or no documentation and teachers just had to figure it out on their own. Parents had to support their children's learning on an ad hoc basis. To date there is still little support for online education even though it is highly likely that students will soon be barred from going to school. Or else, there will be a huge demand to pull students from school and use home schooling completely online.

The greatest need to create a viable education system in these circumstances is for better documentation and hand-holding in order for teachers to create online classrooms. This is where an open-source system with the ability to integrate off the shelf products becomes the go to system for education. Education must become decentralized and more under the control of individual students, parents and teachers. This also includes ciriculum and adjudication. This is the way of the future.

In very basic terms, education requires three entities:
1. a teacher
2. a student
3. a discipline

For example, to demonstrate, let's look at the discipline of mathematics. Let's also say we have  a math teacher who needs to teach students math in the middle of Covid on an online system. We will assume the students have computers with cameras and microphones. It is very quickly discovered that trying to run an online classroom the same way as a real classrooom ends in disaster. In simply cannot be done. Different techniques must be used. 

## Purpose of Education

Modern western education came out of the industrial revolution and was used to train an agricultural citizenry to work in factories. So the purpose of education started out as a means to create more semi-skilled factory workers. And that purpose was pretty much the same up to and throughout the 1950s. Something very dramatic happened to education in the 1960s as a result of the space race and cold war but was forgotten and evolved into creating a consumer-based economy and the "dumbing down" of the population. As a result, the crisis of Covid finds society filled with disempowered individuals and an extreme rarity of competient leaders. This is the result of the past 50 years of edcuation. Education, because of Covid, must decentralize as much as possible. Hence, responsibility for student success, in a very real way, lies with students and parents rather than a centralized authority. And each student learns differently. As a result a more student centered education philosophy has to come into play. And teachers need support to effect different approaches. For example, some states require teachers to pretty well read word for word a prescribed lesson plan. In an online environment, this would result in little motivation for learning. Also, in the traditional education system, there is rarely a chance of collaboration among teachers and little opportunity for consultation between parents, students and teachers. Mostly the administrators are in control of the education process. In an online learning environment the administrators have very little involvement and teachers have to create more individually designed programs for each student. And each student has to work in their own way in order to learn. This is the result of not being in a classroom with 30 or so other students but being alone, one on one, on a computer.

One philosphy of education incorporates the idea that knowledge lies within the student. Rather than knowledge being in possession of a teacher who has to transfer knowledge to the student; the teacher brings the knowledge out from within the student. The student has the knowledge inherent within and the teacher leads the student to discover this knowledge for themselves. Each student has a different understanding of the discipline and becomes empowered with this new knowledge. The understanding and knowledge belongs to the student rather than to some authority that gifted it.

This opens up an idea to have a different approach to our economic system. At present our economic system is based on people acting in their own self interest. As a result, our economy goes through ever increasing cycles of inflation and depression which has devastated the lives of millions of people. Education is seen as a process for the self interest of students and is designed for the self interest of those with economic power. Perhaps education can be utilized to be of service to others, that knowledge can be seen as a commodity for the benefit of society as a whole. 

## An Online Classroom

The author will cite his own experience as a case study. Before Covid began, the author, a retired mathematics teacher, wanted to help native students, both teens and adults, to get their high school mathematics. These students lived on reservations and did not have acccess to the mathematics education they needed in order to qualilfy for university enterance. The author bought a computer designed for streaming with 16 GB of ram and a 0.5 TB SSD drive with 2 TB disk drive. Three monitors, game card, Nvidea video card and an internet card. The box was burned with Ubuntu 18.04 and later upgraded to 20.04. The author had some computer programming experience from the 60s, 70s and 80s. At first, OBS-studio was installed and could utilize a number of web cameras and a Canon T3i camera which was trained on a whiteboard which the author could use to walk through math problems. Another interface was a tablet made from an old Samsung Galaxy 10. Putting all of this together required going through many different sites and trial and error. It took about six months to get the bugs worked out and for everything to work smoothly. Then the author obtained a droplet from Digital Ocean and installed Ngnix in order to stream to different websites. The students mostly use Facebook so a stream had to be set up to do that as well as to other sites. Then Jitsi was installed on the droplet and a virtual camera from OBS-studio interfaced with Jitsi. The author then opened an account with Khan Accademy and with Jitsi could walk students through getting onto Khan Accademy and into the program of learing mathematics. Very quickly, each student had to branch off to their own level and the author became a resource to respond to student questions and request for help on how to answer questions or needing deeper theoretical understanding.

It was obvous that the students would have been unable to learn with just the learning software; they needed an online teacher who could respond in real time. Also, the teacher could not possibly have taught without the learning software. All of this was put together with free open source software and became a very powerful teaching environment. Three of the author's female students have been accepted into university and have moved off reserve to attend classes. They are online learning now and the author can still support them. An adult learner on reserve raises horses and is working on mathematics daily to obtain his high school mathematics and wants to challenge first year calculus. Throughout all of this there are many opportunities to talk about trauma in education, particularly experiences with the residential school system. The mathematics, in this type of learning enviroment, also acts as a path to healing.

The greatest need to provide services to other teachers is in documentation and  video instructions on how to set this stuff up. Teachers really don't have six months of time to try and figure out how to do this. Most teachers have an online leaning program that is given to them. And probably a single laptop that may have been provided and that would be it. Teachers need support from the open source community, not only to create better online classrooms, but also to increase dialogue about education itself. 

The classroom environment may change from the present system to families hiring teachers in online programs. An example may be that a teacher would have three or four families as client families and teach all of their children, or adults, in conjunction with other teachers. This may be a far more successful education model.

## Monetizing

Monetizing online classrooms to empower teachers to teach and students to learn can take many different paths. And probably will. There is a need to organize, manage and market helping teachers with online classrooms and parents with home schooling. This requires a business plan and people to get the word out to teachers of what is available to them. Also, parents and adults need to find teachers for home schooling projects.

It may also be possible that monetization of online education with teachers in support could have rewards for useful projects. There could be some developments that have a direct impact on innovation and the humanities and can themselves be monetized.

Another idea is that there could be some tokenization of online education.

## Work to be Done

The Jitsi platform has advantages to being used in the field of education. It is easy to log into a meeting and a number of classrooms can be going on at the same time. Activity logging may need to be improved. 

Documentation and video instruction is needed. Clear instructions and hand-holding will be necessary for teachers and teachers need to know how to hand-hold students. Anything that helps here is a huge bonus.

Collaboration needs to be organized and encouraged. This takes people to do this.

People are needed to handle marketting and getting the word out.

## Education as an Economic Model

If the wealth of a society is not redistributed to the lowest echelon of society, the society will go broke. The redistribution of wealth in western capitalism is through repeated economic collapse. The failure of capitalism to sustain itself in times of crisis is the result of the members of the economic system retaining wealth at all costs and not redistributing it. This is the result of creating an economic unstable equilibrium.

During ancient times, about 10% of the population were the elite and unemployable and about 90% of the population provided food. During the period of the industrial revolution, only about 10% of the people were required to grow enough food for the rest of the population. This left 80% of the population who were trained to "make stuff" or manufacture and provide goods and services for the population. However, with mechanization, about 10% of the people can make enough stuff and provide services for the rest of the population. This now leaves 70% of the population in a state of being non-productive. This becomes even more severe during a pandemic. A proposal would be to hire this 70% and pay them to learn stuff and consider that productive. However, for such an economic system to work, this 70% would have to be actually productive. The education has to feed back into either growing stuff or making stuff. 

### Scenario 1: Buffalo

In this scenario, let us say there is a group of people who wish to grow buffalo and monetize each buffalo with a 20% annual production of buffalo. A school of buffalo is established in which students are paid to study everything there is about buffalo. This includes poetry of buffalo, history of buffalo, songs and art of buffalo, biology and physics of buffalo and the entire cirriculum of reading, writing and mathematics about buffalo. In a very short time, the group of people are going to have a lot of very healthy buffalo and the students can gain accreditation for their studies.

### Scenario 2: Song Writing

In this scenario a song writer takes courses and learns from from a song-writing master. The writer learns and writes songs in collaboration with others in the song-writing school. The songs are sold by the school and student. The song writer becomes a song-writing master and teacher. This process is similar to apprenticeship programs and guilds.

The above two scenarios show examples of how to "hook" education back into a productive and decentralized economic system. It may be possible to tokenize such systems or to have the government support it and tax it.
