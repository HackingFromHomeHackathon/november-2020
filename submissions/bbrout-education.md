## Education as an Economic Alternative

During the twentieth century in Canada, native people have struggled with the aftermath of the Residential School System where children were taken from thier parents and boarded in schools which mostly were run by peodophiles. Actual education was non-existent and the trauma of education on children who became adults carries on to modern times. Furthermore, the economic environment for native people on Canadian reservations is brutal to say the least. People want to learn and obtain a high school education equivalent to the non-native population and very much want to work and be productive. One of the ways to survive on a reserve is through piece-meal education projects and a common saying is that education is the new buffalo.

At present in the United States of America there is a pandemic of frightening proportions. Two facets of the social structure under stress are education and the economy. Somehow people have to work and be paid and people have to be educated. This project is to explore, and perhaps create, an opportunity to make education a means of production and establish a different economic system. 

When Covid hit various countries in the world, society as a whole shut down and children had to be educated at home through social meeting platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Jitsi was created as an open source social meeting platform which can be modified and used to create online classrooms. There are also many different platforms that can be integrated to create completely different learning environments. From the effects of the present pandemic, an entirely different approach to education becomes vital and can be used as a way to redistribute wealth by people being productive in an education environment.

## Facets of Education

When the pandemic hit teachers were forced to scramble to create an online education system overnight with no help from school boards, political authorities or any organization which was geared to support teachers. Google classroom had to be utilized with little or no documentation and teachers just had to figure it out on their own. Parents had to support their children's learning on an ad hoc basis. To date there is still little support for online education even though it is highly likely that students will soon be barred from going to school. Or else, there will be a huge demand to pull students from school and use home schooling completely online.

The greatest need to create a viable education system in these circumstances is for better documentation and hand-holding in order for teachers to create online classrooms. This is where an open-source system with the ability to integrate off the shelf products becomes the go to system for education. Education must become decentralized and more under the control of individual students, parents and teachers. This also includes ciriculum and adjudication. This is the way of the future.

In very basic terms, education requires three entities:
1. a teacher
2. a student
3. a discipline

For example, to demonstrate, let's look at the discipline of mathematics. Let's also say we have  a math teacher who needs to teach students math in the middle of Covid on an online system. We will assume the students have computers with cameras and microphones. It is very quickly discovered that trying to run an online classroom the same way as a real classrooom ends in disaster. In simply cannot be done. Different techniques must be used. 

## Purpose of Education

Modern western education came out of the industrial revolution and was used to train an agricultural citizenry to work in factories. So the purpose of education started out as a means to create more semi-skilled factory workers. And that purpose was pretty much the same up to and throughout the 1950s. Something very dramatic happened to education in the 1960s as a result of the space race and cold war but was forgotten and evolved into creating a consumer-based economy and the "dumbing down" of the population. As a result, the crisis of Covid finds society filled with disempowered individuals and an extreme rarity of competient leaders. This is the result of the past 50 years of edcuation. Edcuation, because of Covid, must decentralize as much as possible. Hence, responsibility for student success, in a very real way, lies with students and parents rather than a centralized authority. And each student learns differently. As a result a more student centered education philosophy has to come into play. And teachers need support to effect different approaches. For example, some states require teachers to pretty well read word for word a prescribed lesson plan. In an online environment, there is little motivation for learning. Also, in the traditional education system, there is little chance of collaboration among teachers and little opportunity for consultation between parents, students and teachers. Mostly the administrators are in control of the education process. In an online learning environment the administrators have very little involvement and teachers have to create more individually designed programs for each student. And each student has to work in their own way in order to learn. This is the result of not being in a classroom with 30 or so other students but being alone, one on one, on a computer.

One philosphy of education incorporates the idea that knowledge lies within the student. Rather than knowledge being in possession of a teacher who has to transfer knowledge to the student, the teacher brings the knowledge out from within the student. The student has the knowledge inherent within and the teacher leads the student to discover this knowledge for themselves. Each student has a different understanding of the discipline and becomes empowered with this new knowledge. The understanding and knowledge belongs to the student rather than to some authority that gifted it.
