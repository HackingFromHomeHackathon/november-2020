Here are links to the [website repo](https://github.com/ThisIsJohnBrown/unconference) and the [forked Jitsi Meet ](https://github.com/ThisIsJohnBrown/jitsi-meet).

## Summary

Knowledge sharing can be difficult in a WFH environment. It's harder to share small bits of knowledge or discuss things in a natural way like you could around a coffee maker.

unconference seeks to create a flexible solution of providing a space for informal knowledge sharing, entirely self-directed. With a website to provide structure and promotion for Jitsi Meetings, unconference closes the gap on knowledge sharing in a WFH environment.

unconference extends or exposes features of Jitsi Meet core in a fey key ways:

1. Synced views - This is a key if you're running a presentation or a panel discussion.
2. Locked user input - This let's anyone join and participate through the website without being able to unmute themselves
3. Shows other meetings - If a lot of knowledge sharing is happening, a user can browse the different sessions and join what looks interesting

Two use cases show the flexibility of unconference:

1. The VP of Technology wants to interview a lead dev about a project that just launched. The VP can create a panel discussion using Jitsi that will show only their two panels and mute everyone else, no matter how many folks join. Then, the VP can unmute folks that raise their hand and take questions from the audience.
2. A developer is feeling like VS Code isn't working well for them. They create a session called "Give me your best VS Code Extensions" and run an open discussion of the best extensions and hotkeys, where anyone can jump in.

unconference isn't just a replacement for streaming a panel talk or tutorial presentation. It's those things, with live interaction, without the need to do a bunch of setup ahead of time. Just jump in, knowledge share on one platform, and then go see what else is happening!
